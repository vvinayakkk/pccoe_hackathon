1. Introduction
-A network can be defined as a group of computers and other devices
connected in some ways so as to be able to exchange data.
-Each of the devices on the network can be thought of as a node; each
node has a unique address.
-Addresses are numeric quantities that are easy for computers to work
with, but not for humans to remember.
Example: 204.160.241.98
-Some networks also provide names that humans can more easily
remember than numbers.
Example: www.javasoft.com, corresponding to the above numeric
address.
